IDEAS FOR PROEJCT:

Objective measures of genres
Different rulesets for different genres
Types of instruments that go together in certain genres

Check proper formatting for XML?

Pattern ideas:
Enforce time signatures (ignore first measure?)
Check that instruments match cleft (tuba and bass cleft)
Check for excessive rests for all instruments
Check for accident note during long rest
Check for more than 10 notes on piano piece
Check for hands too far apart on piano piece
Check for piano playing same note with both hands at same time

Stretch ideas:
Check for proper band enforcement
Triples && Duplets?

Doable Counterpoint rules:

1. Avoid tritones (A-D#, F-B)
2. Allowed Intervals: Perfect Fourth, Fifth, Octave, major and minor second, major and minor third, ascending minor sixth.
    After ascending minor sixth, must be followed by downward motion.
3. Consecutive skips (interval larger than a step) should be in opposite directions
4. If writing two skips in the same direction, the second must be smaller than the first The first and third note may not 
    be dissonant. These three notes should be from the same triad. These should not span more than an octave when possible.
    (Two skips in the same direction should be avoided when possible)
5. Counterpoint should begin and end on a perfect consonance (Same note, a perfect fifth, a perfect fourth, a octave higher)
    (Allowed to begin on a rest and other notes)
6. Contrary motion should be the norm
7. Perfect consonances must be approached through oblique or contrary motion (contrary=opposite directions, oblique=one stays 
    the same, the other moves)
8. Imperfect consonances may be approached however (major and minor thirds and sixths)
9. Interval of a tenth should be avoided
10. In general, build upward from bass to start (Not sure how enforceable this is)

Achieved in parallel while walking the song:
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (maybe)

Achieved looking at beginning and end:
