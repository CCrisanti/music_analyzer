Music Analyzer/

This a tool to statically analyze sheet music in the form of .mscx files.\
Currently, this tool can analyze pieces from the genre of baroque counterpoint.\
It does so by checking if a piece violates certain rules created by the authors that come\ 
from the book *The Study of Counterpoint: From Johann Joseph Fux's Gradus Ad Parnassum*\
This tool is a proof of concept written as the developers final project for the class\ 
CS6501: Software Artifacts at the University of Virginia\

To run this tool run, you must have a piece of music in .mscx format, or you can use one\
of our test files located in the music directory. The following commands can be used to\
download and run this tool.\
